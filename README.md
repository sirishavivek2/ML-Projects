Univariate Analysis
1. Do the users spend more time on the new landing page than the existing landing page?
   Steps1: Define the null and alternate hypotheses
H0: μ_new <= μ_existing
H1: μ_new > μ_existing
Step 2: Select Appropriate test
For a one-tailed test concerning two population means from two independent populations, where the population standard deviations are unknown, the appropriate test is the independent samples t-test.
Step 3: Decide the significance level
α=0.05

Step 4: Collect and prepare data
Step 5: Calculate the p-value
Step 6: Compare the p-value with Alpha
Step 7: Draw inference
Statistical Significance: The obtained p-value is less than the significance level of 0.05, indicating that the observed difference in the average time spent on the new and existing landing pages is statistically significant. This means that the likelihood of observing such a significant difference by chance, under the assumption of the null hypothesis, is very low.

Time Spent on the New Landing Page: The data suggests that users spend more time on the new landing page compared to the existing landing page. The alternative hypothesis, which states that the average time spent on the new landing page is greater than the average time spent on the existing landing page, is supported by the statistical evidence.

Practical Significance: While the statistical analysis indicates a significant difference, it is also important to consider the practical significance or the magnitude of the difference. The obtained results do not provide specific information about the actual difference in time spent between the two landing pages. Therefore, additional analysis or further investigations may be needed to understand the practical implications of this difference.

Decision-Making: The findings of this analysis can inform decision-making related to landing page optimization. The evidence suggests that the new landing page may be more engaging or effective in capturing user attention, as it leads to a significantly higher average time spent. This information can be used to support decisions on design choices, user experience improvements, or further experimentation.
2. Is the conversion rate (the proportion of users who visit the landing page and get converted) for the new page greater than the conversion rate for the old page?
Step 1: Define the null and alternate hypotheses
H0: p_new <= p_old
H1: p_new > p_old
Step 2: Select Appropriate test
For a one-tailed test concerning two population proportions from two independent populations, the appropriate test to use is the two-sample Z-test for proportions.

Step 3: Decide the significance level
α=0.05

Step 4: Collect and prepare data
Step 5: Calculate the p-value
Step 6: Compare the p-value with 
Step 7: Draw inference
Statistical Significance: The p-value is less than the significance level of 0.05, suggesting that there is strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

Conversion Rate Difference: The results indicate that the conversion rate for the new landing page is statistically significantly greater than the conversion rate for the old landing page. This suggests that the new landing page design may be more effective in converting users compared to the old landing page.

Practical Significance: While the statistical analysis indicates a significant difference in conversion rates, it's important to consider the practical significance or the magnitude of the difference. The obtained result does not provide specific information about the actual difference in conversion rates between the two landing pages. Additional analysis or further investigations may be necessary to understand the practical implications of this difference.

Decision-Making: The findings from this analysis can inform decision-making related to landing page optimization. The evidence suggests that implementing the new landing page may lead to a higher conversion rate, which can positively impact business outcomes. However, it is important to consider other factors such as user experience, marketing strategies, and cost-effectiveness before making conclusive decisions.

3. Is the conversion and preferred language are independent or related?
Perform Visual Analysis
Step 1: Define the null and alternate hypotheses
H0: The converted status and preferred language are independent.
H1: The converted status and preferred language are dependent.
Step 2: Select Appropriate test
The chi-square test of independence is used to assess whether there is a significant association or dependency between two categorical variables.

Step 3: Decide the significance level
α=0.05

Step 4: Collect and prepare data

Step 7: Draw inference
Statistical Significance: The p-value is greater than the chosen significance level of 0.05. This indicates that we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

Independence: The p-value suggests that there is no significant association or dependency between the converted status and preferred language.

Conclusion: Based on the results, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, which suggests that the converted status and preferred language are independent variables. This means that there is no significant evidence to suggest that the preferred language has an influence on the conversion status.

Practical Implications: The lack of a significant association between the converted status and preferred language suggests that other factors may play a more significant role in determining the conversion status. It indicates that the preferred language alone may not be a strong predictor or influencer of the conversion outcome.
4. Is the time spent on the new page same for the different language users?
Perform Visual Analysis
Step 1: Define the null and alternate hypotheses
H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3 = ... = μn
H1: At least one pair of means is significantly different
where:

μ1, μ2, μ3, ..., μn represent the population means of time spent on the new page for different language users.

Step 2: Select Appropriate test
The one-way ANOVA test is used to compare the means of three or more independent groups. It assesses whether there are any statistically significant differences among the means of the groups based on the variances and means of the samples.

Step 3: Decide the significance level
α=0.05

Step 4: Collect and prepare data
Step 5: Calculate the p-value
Step 6: Compare the p-value with Alpha
Step 7: Draw inference
Statistical Significance: The p-value is greater than the chosen significance level (0.05). This suggests that there is no significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

Equality of Means: The p-value indicates that there is no significant difference in the mean time spent on the new page among the different language user groups.

Conclusion: Based on the results, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, which suggests that the mean time spent on the new page is likely similar across English, French, and Spanish language users.

Practical Implications: The lack of a significant difference in mean time spent on the new page among language user groups suggests that the language preference may not significantly impact the time spent on the new page. Other factors or variables might have a more substantial influence on the time spent.

Conclusion and Business Recommendations
Conclusions:

Conversion Rate: The analysis comparing the conversion rates for the new and old landing pages indicated a statistically significant difference. The new landing page showed a higher conversion rate compared to the old landing page. This suggests that implementing the new landing page could potentially lead to increased conversions.

Time Spent on the New Page: The analysis of the time spent on the new page for different language users did not reveal a significant difference. The preferred language did not appear to have a substantial impact on the time users spent on the new page. Therefore, language preference may not be a key factor influencing engagement with the page.

Conversion Status and Preferred Language: The analysis of the contingency table did not provide significant evidence of an association between the conversion status and preferred language. The preferred language of the users did not appear to be strongly related to their conversion status. Other factors may have a more significant influence on the conversion outcome.

Business Recommendations:

Implement the New Landing Page: Based on the significantly higher conversion rate observed for the new landing page, it is recommended to implement and promote the new landing page to attract more conversions. Monitor and track the performance of the new page to assess its long-term impact on conversions.

Focus on User Experience: While language preference did not significantly affect the time spent on the new page or the conversion status, it is still essential to prioritize a positive user experience. Ensure that the page content and design are user-friendly, accessible, and cater to a diverse audience.

Consider Additional Factors: While language preference did not show a strong association with the conversion status, it is crucial to consider other factors that may impact conversions. Analyze other variables such as demographics, source of traffic, or user behavior to identify potential factors influencing conversion rates.

Continuous Testing and Optimization: Conduct ongoing testing and optimization of landing pages to identify the most effective designs, content, and user experiences. A/B testing and user feedback can provide valuable insights for further optimization efforts.
